/*
 * Saving and restoring MSR_SPEC_CTRL state is a little tricky.
 *
 * We want the guests choice of SPEC_CTRL while in guest context, and Xen's
 * choice (set or clear, depending on the hardware) while running in Xen
 * context.  Therefore, a simplistic algorithm is:
 *
 *  - Set/clear IBRS on entry to Xen
 *  - Set the guests' choice on exit to guest
 *  - Leave SPEC_CTRL unchanged on exit to xen
 *
 * There are two complicating factors:
 *  1) HVM guests can have direct access to the MSR, so it can change
 *     behind Xen's back.
 *  2) An NMI or MCE can interrupt at any point, including early in the entry
 *     path, or late in the exit path after restoring the guest value.  This
 *     will corrupt the guest value.
 *
 * Factor 1 is dealt with by relying on NMIs/MCEs being blocked immediately
 * after VMEXIT.  The VMEXIT-specific code reads MSR_SPEC_CTRL and updates
 * current before loading Xen's MSR_SPEC_CTRL setting.
 *
 * Factor 2 is harder.  We maintain a shadow_spec_ctrl value, and a use_shadow
 * boolean in the per cpu spec_ctrl_flags.  The synchronous use is:
 *
 *  1) Store guest value in shadow_spec_ctrl
 *  2) Set the use_shadow boolean
 *  3) Load guest value into MSR_SPEC_CTRL
 *  4) Exit to guest
 *  5) Entry from guest
 *  6) Clear the use_shadow boolean
 *  7) Load Xen's value into MSR_SPEC_CTRL
 *
 * The asynchronous use for interrupts/exceptions is:
 *  -  Set/clear IBRS on entry to Xen
 *  -  On exit to Xen, check use_shadow
 *  -  If set, load shadow_spec_ctrl
 *
 * Therefore, an interrupt/exception which hits the synchronous path between
 * steps 2 and 6 will restore the shadow value rather than leaving Xen's value
 * loaded and corrupting the value used in guest context.
 *
 * The following ASM fragments implement this algorithm.  See their local
 * comments for further details.
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_ENTRY_FROM_HVM
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_ENTRY_FROM_PV
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_ENTRY_FROM_INTR
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_ENTRY_FROM_INTR_IST
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_EXIT_TO_XEN_IST
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_EXIT_TO_XEN
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_EXIT_TO_PV
 *  - SPEC_CTRL_EXIT_TO_HVM
