These process documents are used by those involved in releasing Xen to
help keep the releases high quality, our release preparation
well-organised, and to help avoid errors.

They are living documents, and no special approval is needed to modify
them beyond the usual acks for commit.  They should be updated as and
when it seems expediant.

Also, these documents are not to be slavishly followed.  Intelligent
application of the guidelines means understanding, and giving effect
to, the purpose behind any imprecation.

Especially, the shell runes should not be executed blindly.  They are
prompts to think about what should be done, and in what order; but
often, the standard runes are not appropriate.
